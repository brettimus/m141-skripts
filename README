-- YOU NEED TO GIVE THESE EXECUTABLE PERMISSIONS

chmod 755 rmd_convert
chmod 755 batch_convert.r

-- THEN ADD THE FOLDER THEY'RE IN TO THE $PATH VARIABLE

export PATH=$PATH:path_to_skript_directory

-- This repo contains the following:

rmd_convert < zip_file_name_sans_extension >
batch_convert.r

-- Usage is kind of cumbersome, sorry.
-- Here's an example,
--
-- Download the zip of .rmd files from Moodle
-- Save as homeworks.zip
-- Change to directory with the zip
-- Execute the following:

rmd_convert homeworks

-- This will create a new directory called "homeworks"
-- Then, it will unzip homeworks.zip into homeworks.
-- Next, it will call the RScript, batch_convert.r
--
--
-- batch_convert.r does the following:
--
-- ~ loads all the .RMD files in the current directory (homeworks/)
-- ~ creates a new directory (lab_html/)
-- ~ converts all .RMD files to .HTML and puts them in lab_html/
-- ~ outputs the names of students who didn't upload .RMD files
